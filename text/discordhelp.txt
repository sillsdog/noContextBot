Hey There! I'm No Context Bot.
I was programmed by @robuyasu#3100, and was created September 9, 2018.

My purpose is to select recent messages, and tweet one of them.
I am coded in Python, and hosted at heroku.

```asciidoc
= Public Commands =
1:: !version
Returns the version of No Context Bot.

2:: !about / !help
DMs the user the help/about message.
Returns help/about message.
   
= Client Owner Commands =
1:: !post
Posts to the twitter the following message after the space.
Returns the twitter.Status post instance in string form.

2:: !ppost
Returns string form of text and media attachments.

3:: !bootdown
Sets ContextOn to False. This disables the post_tweets function, causing tweets to turn off.

4:: !bootup
Sets ContextOn to True. This enables the post_tweets function, causing tweets to run.
```
